# Examples have moved to the [APACAI Cookbook](https://github.com/apacai/apacai-cookbook/)

Looking for code examples? Visit the [APACAI Cookbook](https://github.com/apacai/apacai-cookbook/), which shares examples of how to use the APACAI Python library to accomplish common tasks.

Prior to July 2022, code examples were hosted in this examples folder; going forward, code examples will be hosted in the [APACAI Cookbook](https://github.com/apacai/apacai-cookbook/).

This separation will help keep the [APACAI Python library](https://github.com/apacai/apacai-python) simple and small, without extra files or dependencies.
